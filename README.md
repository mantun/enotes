# Encrypted Notepad

It does only one thing, but aims to do it perfectly - a Notepad-like simple text editor where files are saved (and later loaded) encrypted with industrial strength algorithms. Available both for the desktop (as a Java application) and on Android.

Unencrypted data is never stored on-disk.
